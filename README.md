# Grade Fetch

## Overview

This started out as a simple application to automatically retrieve grades from my kid's school website. I set up [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to scrape the site and save data to a local file. From there, I manually imported the data into a spreadsheet for further analysis and charting.

### Hey, there's an app in here

Now I could have gone down the path of building a better spreadsheet importer, but that wouldn't have been the *Web Developer Wayâ„¢*. These analysis and visualization tools need to be made into a modern app.

I chose to keep the app together and in one repo for the time being for convenience sake. It may make sense to break it up into data `fetch` (scrape), `model` (API), and `view` pieces once the project matures. The following Roadmap is provisional and will like change as time goes on.

### Roadmap

1. [x] Set up environment
   1. [x] Node (v12) + npm
   2. [x] [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
   3. [x] [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org)
2. [x] Scrape student information from school website.
   1. [x] Add [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
   2. [x] Set up DOM selectors to capture page data.
   3. [x] Design data objects.
   4. [x] Store captured data (directly) in flat files.
3. [ ] Create REST API to save scraped data and retrieve for visualization.
   1. [x] Add [Express](https://expressjs.com) web framework.
   2. [x] Add rudimentary models and routes for data retrieval.
   3. [ ] Add models and routes for data saves.
   4. [ ] Migrate captured data saves to use API.
4. [x] Set up test framework.
   1. [x] Add [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
   2. [x] Add initial tests.
5. [ ] Migrate REST API to GraphQL.
6. [ ] Add "view" framework.
   1. [ ] Add [Vue](https://nuxtjs.org).
   2. [ ] Add [charts](https://madewithvuejs.com/charts).
7. [ ] Migrate data from flat file to database.
   1. [ ] Add [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) and [Mongoose]([https://](https://mongoosejs.com)).
   2. [ ] Migrate models from using flat files to using Mongoose.
8. [ ] Add authentication.
9. [ ] Migrate from local app to cloud.

#### Additional considerations for Roadmap

* Use Docker container for MongoDB.
* Migrate to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for its type checking, autocompletion in VSCode, and because it's the latest hotness.
* Migrate to ES6 modules. Node 12+ supports the new format, but my initial tests failed. Add [Babel](https://babeljs.io)?
* Create a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) version of the client-side?
